1. WordCount Application Using Hadoop MapReduce (Java, Local Setup)

Case Study:
A small local newspaper organization stores digital articles and wants to analyze word usage frequency in their archives. To avoid cloud dependency and maintain cost-effectiveness, they choose a local Hadoop setup for word count analysis using MapReduce in Java.

Conceptual Explanation:
- **MapReduce** is a programming model in Hadoop for processing large data sets.
- **Mapper** processes input data and emits key-value pairs.
- **Reducer** aggregates values for each key.
- The **WordCount** problem is the "Hello World" of MapReduce.
- Hadoop allows running MapReduce jobs in a "standalone" mode for local development and testing.

Flow:
1. **Input**: Text files stored locally.
2. **Mapper**: Reads lines, tokenizes words, emits (word, 1).
3. **Shuffle and Sort**: Groups all pairs by word.
4. **Reducer**: Sums counts for each word, emits (word, count).
5. **Output**: Local directory with results.

Challenges:
- Setting up Hadoop in standalone mode.
- Managing local HDFS directories.
- Understanding input/output formats (TextInputFormat, TextOutputFormat).

2. Log File Processing Using MapReduce

Case Study:
An IT firm maintains system logs for 100+ servers and wants to analyze frequent error types, login attempts, and session durations. They design a distributed log file analyzer using MapReduce.

Conceptual Explanation:
- System logs are semi-structured, high-volume, and timestamped.
- **MapReduce** handles scalability for analyzing logs across machines.
- Each log entry is parsed and key attributes (e.g., timestamp, error code) are extracted.

Flow:
1. **Input**: Distributed log files (e.g., from web/app servers).
2. **Mapper**: Parses logs, emits relevant fields (e.g., (ERROR_TYPE, 1)).
3. **Reducer**: Aggregates counts/errors.
4. **Advanced Use**: Can detect trends, IP activity, or login spikes.

Benefits:
- Scalability: Efficient across GBs/TBs of logs.
- Parallel Processing: Each node processes logs independently.
- Real-world: Used in intrusion detection, server uptime monitoring.

Challenges:
- Log format inconsistencies.
- Handling malformed entries.
- Sorting logs for time-based patterns.

3. Simple Program in SCALA Using Apache Spark

Case Study:
A startup wants to analyze customer review sentiment from app feedback using Apache Spark on local machines. They prefer Scala for Sparkâ€™s native performance.

Conceptual Explanation:
- **Apache Spark** is a fast, general-purpose cluster computing system.
- **RDD** (Resilient Distributed Dataset): Fundamental Spark abstraction.
- Scala integrates natively with Spark, ideal for performance and functional programming.
- Spark processes data in-memory, making it faster than MapReduce.

Typical Scala Spark Program Flow:
1. **Create SparkContext**: Entry point for Spark functionality.
2. **Load Data**: Read text file using `sc.textFile("path")`.
3. **Transformations**: Use `.flatMap`, `.map`, `.reduceByKey` to process.
4. **Actions**: Use `.collect`, `.saveAsTextFile` to produce output.

Use Case:
- Count most common words in user reviews.
- Filter reviews mentioning specific keywords (e.g., "bug", "love").
- Perform basic sentiment analysis using word lists.

Benefits:
- Near real-time data processing.
- Easy to scale from laptop to cluster.
- Rich API for functional transformations.

Challenges:
- Requires understanding of functional programming.
- Requires managing Spark environment locally or on a cluster.

1. Case Study: Word Count Using Hadoop MapReduce in Java
ðŸ“˜ Conceptual Definition
Hadoop MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique for large-scale data processing. It involves two major functions:

Map function: Processes input key/value pairs to produce intermediate key/value pairs.

Reduce function: Merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.

ðŸ’¼ Case Study: Processing Book Manuscripts for Word Analysis
Scenario:
A publishing house receives thousands of manuscript submissions in digital text format every month. The editorial team wants to analyze:

The most frequently used words by each author.

Vocabulary diversity.

Common cliches (e.g., overused words).

Challenges:
Large volume of text (in GBs).

Need for scalable word frequency analysis.

Need for batch processing and offline storage.

Solution Using Hadoop MapReduce:
Each manuscript is treated as an input split.

Mapper extracts each word and emits it as a key with a count of 1.

Reducer aggregates the word counts.

This system is deployed in a local standalone Hadoop setup initially for testing and then scaled to a pseudo-distributed setup.

Outcome:
Editors receive analytical reports showing top used words, usage trends, and keyword density.

This helps in manuscript evaluation and keyword optimization for digital publishing.

2. Case Study: System Log File Processing Using MapReduce
ðŸ“˜ Conceptual Definition
Log processing with MapReduce refers to parsing, filtering, and aggregating log data from various systems (web servers, applications, etc.) to generate insights like:

Error frequencies

Request patterns

User behavior

ðŸ’¼ Case Study: Monitoring Server Health and Usage in a Data Center
Scenario:
A data center handles millions of requests daily. System administrators need to:

Monitor system errors and failures.

Track peak usage times.

Detect suspicious IP addresses (potential attacks).

Challenges:
Logs are huge (terabytes per day).

Searching through plain logs is inefficient.

Manual inspection is not scalable.

Solution Using MapReduce:
Log files are stored on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

Mapper parses each log line and emits relevant fields (e.g., IP, timestamp, status code).

Reducer groups these entries to count frequency of events such as:

Number of 404 errors

Top 10 IPs by request count

Time intervals with highest traffic

Outcome:
Real-time dashboards are updated every hour using processed logs.

Admins receive alerts for IP addresses with high error requests (possible DDoS).

Historical usage trends are used for resource planning.

Tools Used:
Hadoop (MapReduce, HDFS)

Apache Hive (for querying results)

3. Case Study: Apache Spark Program in Scala
ðŸ“˜ Conceptual Definition
Apache Spark is a fast, in-memory data processing engine suitable for large-scale data analysis. Scala is its native language, offering concise syntax and functional programming features.

Spark uses:

RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) for distributed memory abstraction.

Transformations (e.g., map, filter) and actions (e.g., reduce, count) for data processing.

ðŸ’¼ Case Study: Real-Time Product Review Analysis for an E-commerce Platform
Scenario:
An e-commerce site receives thousands of product reviews daily. The marketing team wants:

Sentiment analysis on reviews.

Frequent keywords by product category.

Identification of fake/spam reviews.

Challenges:
Data velocity is high (real-time or near real-time).

Need for low-latency processing.

Variety in input (different languages, formats).

Solution Using Spark + Scala:
Review data is streamed from a message broker (like Kafka).

Spark reads data in mini-batches (Structured Streaming).

Data is tokenized and cleaned using Scala string methods.

Transformations:

filter() to remove stop words

flatMap() to tokenize

reduceByKey() to count keywords

Sentiment scores are computed using a predefined lexicon.

Outcome:
Dashboard displays live sentiment scores and keyword trends.

The platform flags suspicious reviews based on repetition and IP tracking.

Helps product managers react quickly to customer feedback.

Tools Used:
Apache Spark (Scala)

Apache Kafka

Elasticsearch (for dashboarding)
